    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <p class="note">This site is a public bulletin board that helps connect people who need off-road recovery with volunteers. It is not a dispatch center or a business. Volunteers and requesters act at their own risk.</p>

      <!-- Requesting Help -->
      <div>
        <details open>
          <summary>How do I request recovery help?</summary>
          <p>Post in our bulletin board <a href="FACEBOOK_GROUP_URL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FACEBOOK_GROUP_NAME</a> with photos, the pinned location, access directions, and any hazards. You can also submit the request form at <a href="REQUEST_FORM_URL">REQUEST_FORM_URL</a> or check the volunteer map at <a href="map.html">map.html</a> when available.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>How fast will someone respond?</summary>
          <p>There is no guaranteed response time. Volunteers respond when they can. Posting clear info and a precise location improves your chances.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Does this cost money?</summary>
          <p>Standard recoveries are free. No one may demand payment. If a tow or paid service replies, they must state fees up front and you may refuse service.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What info should I include in my post?</summary>
          <ul>
            <li>Photos from multiple angles of the vehicle and terrain</li>
            <li>Pinned GPS location or exact address plus access route and landmarks</li>
            <li>Vehicle make, model, tire size, 2WD or 4WD, and if you have recovery points</li>
            <li>Hazards like water depth, mud, sand, ice, traffic, or private gates</li>
            <li>Your preferred or allowed methods and gear if you have a preference</li>
          </ul>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can I request on behalf of someone else?</summary>
          <p>Yes, but the owner should be present and consent to recovery before any work starts.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What if my situation becomes dangerous or life threatening?</summary>
          <p>Call 911 first. Volunteers are not a substitute for emergency services, law enforcement, or professional towing in hazardous conditions.</p>
        </details>
      </div>

      <!-- Volunteers and Safety -->
      <div>
        <details>
          <summary>Who are the volunteers?</summary>
          <p>Independent off-road enthusiasts with varying experience and equipment. They are not screened or supervised by this site.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What gear is commonly used?</summary>
          <p>Rated recovery points, soft shackles, recovery ropes or straps, traction boards, winches, tree savers, and basic safety gear. Chains are discouraged.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Who is responsible for damage?</summary>
          <p>Each participant is responsible for their own vehicle and equipment. By participating you accept the risks. Take before and after photos.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Can volunteers operate after drinking or using drugs?</summary>
          <p>No. If someone appears impaired do not engage in the recovery.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Is trespassing allowed to reach a stuck vehicle?</summary>
          <p>No. Get permission to access private property. Obey all laws and land use rules.</p>
        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>What is the difference between recovery and towing?</summary>
          <p>Recovery is extracting a stuck vehicle using off-road techniques. Towing is transporting a vehicle on public roads and may require licensing and fees. Volunteers do recoveries. Tow companies handle paid transport.</p>

    <!-- Listings and Map -->
    <div class="card">
      <h3>Map Listings and Updates</h3>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I get listed on the volunteer map?</summary>
        <p>Fill out the volunteer form at <a href="VOLUNTEER_FORM_URL">VOLUNTEER_FORM_URL</a>. Provide a geocodable address or landmark for your pin. It does not need to be your home address.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>How do I update or remove my listing?</summary>
        <p>Submit the form with the option to update an existing record or email <a href="mailto:CONTACT_EMAIL">CONTACT_EMAIL</a> with your changes. Include the name, phone, region, and the updated pin location.</p>
      </details>
      <details>
        <summary>Why do you need a specific address for the pin?</summary>
        <p>The map needs coordinates to calculate distance and show the closest volunteers. You can use a nearby public landmark if you prefer.</p>
      </details>

      </details>
      <details>
