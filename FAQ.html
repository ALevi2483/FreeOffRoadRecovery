          <h2 style="margin-top:0">Is this a professional service?</h2>
          <p>No. This is a community bulletin board for volunteers. Use at your own risk.</p>

          <h2>Does it cost anything?</h2>
          <p>No. Volunteers offer their time freely. You may choose to offer gas money or a thank-you, but it is not required.</p>

          <h2>What should I include when I post a request?</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>Your GPS location (pin or coordinates)</li>
            <li>Vehicle details (make, model, tires, recovery points)</li>
            <li>Terrain description (mud, sand, snow, water, incline, etc.)</li>
            <li>Any gear you already have (winch, tow straps, shackles, etc.)</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>What if I need urgent or emergency help?</h2>
          <p>
            Call 911 if anyone’s life or safety is at risk.  
            This site is for community volunteer assistance, not emergency response.
          </p>

          <h2>Can I become a volunteer?</h2>
          <p>
            Yes. Use the volunteer signup form (link on the main site) to share your info and get added to the map/directory.
